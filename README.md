# Configuration files for Suckless' softwares

I enjoyed the privilege of being a unix noob and made a lot of mistakes when
managing my custom Suckless configuration. These mistakes led me to a conclusion that I
need a repository to *solely* store my config files, so here we are. In this
repository, I tracked the changes in my configuration. My main focus is to make
a minimally configured build that I can replicate in any machine. The fonts I'm
using are `Inconsolata` and `FontAwesome`.
